# dogFriendly-WestMidlands

A guide to tried &amp; tested dog friendly places in the West Midlands. Built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. I chose not to use a framework in this project as I wanted to really use my imagination and test my CSS skills to the limit.

This is a personal project created by myself and is a a blog style website based around my dog and his adventures.

To do:
Add footers to all pages for consistency
remove target_blank from navbar (too many tabs)
Make responsive

Finish all the pages (obviously)
