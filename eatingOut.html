     The Horns Inn is a family friendly pub, nestled in the heart of Cannock Chase. A great menu with proper pub classics means there is something for everyone. 
    Dogs are allowed in the bar area and this can become crowded at peak times but you can book ahead. All the staff give you a fuss, and there is ample biscuits & water available.

   Dubbed as "probably the best indie bar in the north" , the Stone Roses bar is great for a drink whilst being surround by memoribilia and for listening to iconic indie tunes. Perfect for taking a break from shopping. Dogs are allowed, however you cannot book. We would recommend visiting during the day as it can get very busy on evenings with drinkers. They don't serve food so have lost a paw.

Lovely dog friendly venue with easy booking online. Board Games cafe with lots of choice and knowledgeable staff if you get stuck on game rules. Staff are quick to serve you with a 'flag' system in place. They serve a range of alcoholic and non-alcoholic drinks including locally brewed beer. We are yet to try the food but it looked delicious! This place deserves 5 paws!

      Brewdog is a great bar, less than 5 minutes from New Street Station. We didn't book but there is plenty of seating upstairs and downstairs so finding a table wasn't a problem as the entire bar is dog friendly. Plenty of water stations, biscuits, fuss from the staff & even doggy beer available too. We had some cauliflower wings and a tasting board for the beer, both were enjoyable. We will be back to Brewdog.

Tucked away in the Gas Street area of Birmingham it would be easy to miss this little bar on the canal. As the title suggests this is a Gin bar with every type of gin imaginable available. We didn't have food during our visit but they do serve food. Small venue so best to book ahead - we were told only small dogs are allowed in the venue. No water bowls or biscuits available but we do always carry our own anyway. Staff loved seeing me and made a fuss of me.

  This pub is lovely and modern with a country feel. It's warm and cosy with an extensive range of cocktails and food. Fairly good value for money and easy to book online. Dogs are allowed in the bar area, there is a wood fire which is lovely in the winter. When booking chose 'pub bookings' as the area. Service was great and attitude towards dogs was 100% friendly!
